Experience-Based Salary Prediction
Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting salaries based on years of experience using a linear regression model. The goal is to understand how experience influences salary, providing useful insights for job seekers, HR teams, and anyone interested in salary trends. By analyzing real-world data, the model predicts salaries based on inputted experience, helping individuals or companies forecast earnings.

How to Use the Project
